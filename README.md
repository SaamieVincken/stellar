## Getting Started
For each phase the conditions for inclusion are defined as criteria for identifying in which phase a star is in, focusing on parameters like luminosity, mass, and surface temperature. These criteria are used for implementation of the algorithm for stellar phases. The values contribute to the understanding of a starâ€™s evolution and how to visualize the phases for the 3D models.
